It started with selling freshly caught trout to elderly people in my neighbourhood during high school, as they rarely got the chance to get their hands on some. In my mid-twenties, I counted all the things I had done at that time and realised that I had experienced over 20 professions varying from the odd construction gigs to bakery assistant to restaurant chef - I even cleaned public transport vehicles during nights in Helsinki while studying arts. That pretty much defines me both professionally and personally - I have never shied away from new things, responsibility or tasks of any kind, as long as I sensed that there is a possibility to learn something on the way. Good or bad, I find ways to enhance my understanding of myself, my surroundings and of people. Later on in life, I learned to channel this and found myself in a leadership role in a company that works for people and with people in distress, and here I found something that felt right. A role that was ever-changing and evolving, a role where you get challenged every day and foremost get to learn stuff and at the same time get to support and help your colleagues in their respective quests. I have been on this track for a decade now and not regretted a second of it, and now I can finally make sense of it to my kid: \"well son, Daddy is a ninja\" and my son replies \"wauu that's so cool Daddy, I want to be a ninja too, like kung-fu panda\".
