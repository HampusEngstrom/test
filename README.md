[Unit tests]: It is important to have some testing included to decrease the number of bugs with small effort.
[Infinity scroll]: Due to performance issues loading 200 images at once.
[Sort and filtering]: To up the level of complexity in the application.
[Responsive design]: Smaller devices are often used and should be supported.
[Fancy animations]: Preloaders for the app and the images, because it gives a nice feeling to it.
